          We made a smart decision in hiring Engr. Jayvee of Flameguard to design our fire
          protection system. He saved us a significant amount of money on his design that
          meets our facility's specific requirements while keeping it both effective and
          affordable. His remarkable proficiency in safeguarding facilities from the
          hazards of flammable liquids is rather impressive, something that we expect from
          someone with multiple recognitions from NFPA.
